# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Autors RUs is having some trouble defining which variables may be causing changes in the milleage per gallon (mpg) offered by their new prototype (MechaCar), and is seeking for an analysis that may offer some insight on what factors could diminish the car's performance. Also, this 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The first part of this analysis is focused on understanding which variables affect the mpg achieved by the different prototypes built fo the MechaCar. Such factors are:

### Vehicle Length

According to our analysis, there is not sufficient evidence to refute the hypothesis that the vehicle length doesn't affect milleage per galon. This can be supported by further analysis regarding the aerodynamics of the vehicles or the materials used to build each prottype, as well as horsepower and traction.

### Vehicle Weight

According to our analysis, there is proof to refute the hypthesis that the vehicle weight doesn't affect the milleage per galon. This can be easily explained as it seems clear that higher weight inherently means that the car will have to use mor power to move, thus consuming more gasoline.

### Spolier Angle

According to our analysis, there is proof to refute the hypthesis that the spolier angle doesn't affect the milleage per galon. This is explained by the aerodynamics of the car, meaning that certain angles will cause the car to face higher resistance in it's advance, increasing the effort required to move and therefore consuming more gasoline.

### Ground Clearance

According to our analysis, there is not sufficient evidence to refute the hypothesis that the ground clearance doesn't affect milleage per galon. This can be understood as the fact that distance between the car and the ground has little to none effect on resistance faced by the car when moving.

### AWD (All Wheel Drive)

![AWD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89816213/148723033-9224f5f7-83df-45a0-b212-30a9534df8df.PNG)

According to our analysis, there is proof to refute the hypthesis that having AWD doesn't affect the milleage per galon. This is a common factor in all cars, since the transmission requires higher torque to move all wheels, ather than focusing the effort on tthe two wheels either in the front or in the back.

### Conclusions to the variables presented for the linear regression model 

A linear regression model is useful to predict which factors can cause a lower performance in gasoline consumption. Given that not all variables seem to be relevant to understand this specific factor, it also seems to clear the way to focus on the ones that show a higher correlation to it.
